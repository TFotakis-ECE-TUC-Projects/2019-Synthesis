# TUC Course: Analysis and Design of Telecommunication Systems
---

## Semester Project overview
Purpose of this project is to create a wireless sensor network in order to detect smoke in the TUC ECE's department building canteen and decide on which area(s) it exists.

### Main idea
Smoke has the ability to diffuse and absorb light causing its intensity to decrease. Using its characteristics, light intensity can be measured by using sensors such as photodiodes, phototransistors or even photovoltaic panels.

In order to cover a large amount of the available plane, lasers can be used in combination with mirrors as shown in the schematic below. By splitting the plane into cells in a table of 2 rows and 3 columns, detection of smoke in a specific cell can be done by combining the detection of smoke from at least two sensors, one from the columns and one from the rows.
